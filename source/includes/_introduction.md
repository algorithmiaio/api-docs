# Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithmia API documentation! You can use the API to access any algorithm in the marketplace.

We have clients & libraries in multiple languages. We encourage you to click on the different language tabs at the top of the right-side pane to see code samples in your language of choice. 

This documentation will serve as a reference as you start to integrate the Algorithmia API into your code.

If this is your first time trying Algorithmia, you might find it useful to start with our [Getting Started guide](http://developers.algorithmia.com/basics/getting-started/), which can be found alongside many other resources in the [Algorithmia Developer Center](http://developers.algorithmia.com/).

**Note**: <b>Please note that R is in beta, and if you would like to request access, email <a href="mailto:info@algorithmia.com">info@algorithmia.com</a></b>
